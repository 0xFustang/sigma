title: FileFix - Suspicious Child Process from Browser File Upload Abuse
id: 4be03877-d5b6-4520-85c9-a5911c0a656c
status: experimental
description: |
    Detects potentially suspicious subprocesses such as LOLBINs spawned by web browsers. This activity could be associated with the "FileFix" social engineering technique,
    where users are tricked into launching File Explorer via a browser-based phishing page and pasting malicious commands into the address bar.
    The technique abuses clipboard manipulation and disguises command execution as benign file path access, resulting in covert execution of system utilities.
